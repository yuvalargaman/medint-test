6	1	1	Adequate context provided (intracranial pressure, blood pressure, heart rate) and relevant information is asked. However, the question could be more specific about what signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure are being referred to.
6	1	2	The question is unclear and too broad, as it could apply to various situations. It would be better rephrased to focus on a specific aspect of the patient's presentation (e.g., "Would an immediate CT scan be more appropriate given the patient's severe headache and confusion?").
6	1	3	A relevant and context-specific question that seeks important information about potential trauma or injuries.
6	1	4	The question is somewhat broad but still relevant to the patient's presentation. It could be rephrased for greater specificity (e.g., "Is there a history of stroke or bleeding disorders that would affect the patient's symptoms?").
6	1	5	Adequate context provided and relevant information is asked about the patient's level of consciousness.
6	1	6	A relevant and context-specific question that seeks important information about potential focal neurological deficits.
6	1	7	Adequate context provided and relevant information is asked about recent changes in vision, hearing, or sense of smell.
6	1	8	A relevant and context-specific question that seeks important information about other symptoms or signs.
6	2	1	Detailed review of medical history could be helpful but the question is too general. It would be better rephrased to focus on specific aspects (e.g., "Is there a history of seizure disorder or brain tumors that could contribute to the patient's symptoms?").
6	2	2	A valid concern about alternative explanations for the patient's symptoms, but the question could be more specific and focused.
6	2	3	Adequate context provided and relevant information is asked about recent changes in medications or dosages.
6	2	4	A somewhat abstract question that doesn't directly relate to the patient's presentation. It would be better rephrased to focus on specific aspects of her medical history (e.g., "What factors contribute to the complexity of this patient's hypertension management?").
6	2	5	The question is too general and doesn't directly relate to the patient's presentation. It would be better rephrased to focus on specific aspects of individual differences that could impact health outcomes.
6	2	6	A valid concern about common pitfalls or biases, but the question could be more specific and focused (e.g., "What are some key cognitive biases healthcare providers should be aware of when making diagnostic decisions?").
6	2	7	A relevant and context-specific question that seeks important information about patient engagement and adherence to treatment regimens.
6	2	8	A somewhat abstract question that doesn't directly relate to the patient's presentation. It would be better rephrased to focus on specific cultural or societal factors that could impact patient care (e.g., "How do cultural beliefs about health and illness influence the patient's understanding of her condition?").
